I am a PhD candidate in Geosciences at Princeton University with a focus in Geomicrobiology and Astrobiology. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of microbial ecology, biochemistry, and geochemistry. I utilize techniques from traditional microbiology, metagenomics, and analytical chemistry to study “extreme” terrestrial environments, the microorganisms that inhabit them, and the strategies life employs to survive under such challenging conditions. My research has spanned topics from bacterial ether lipid production in peat environments to microbial trace gas oxidation in desert soils as analogs for the surface environments of early and modern Mars. My current thesis work explores the microbial communities of soils surrounding hot springs in the salt flats of the Andean Altiplano, Chile, and the geothermal basins of Yellowstone National Park.
