I am passionate about science education. In addition to my research, I consider teaching both students and the public about the microbial world to be a priority for me as a scientist.

I have been privileged to have the opportunity to work with undergraduate students at all levels of experience during my time at Princeton, both as a direct mentor and as a group educator. 

## Research Mentees
